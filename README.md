# web_scraping
In this project, I write a short code in Javascript to collect information from a website. This code is used in Google Apps Script integrated into Google Sheets.  

Input is UEN (Unique Entity Number) which is a distinct identification number assigned to business entities registered in Singapore.  

Output is SSIC code (Singapore Standard Industrial Classification) which is the national standard for classifying of economic activities undertaken by economic units.
